# PMUT-FEM-Simulation-using-COMSOL
This repository contains a finite element simulation of a Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT), carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics. The goal is to analyze the static and dynamic mechanical behavior of the device, estimate resonance frequencies, and validate design parameters for a target working frequency of **6 MHz**.
